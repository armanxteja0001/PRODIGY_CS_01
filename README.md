🔐 Task 01 – Caesar Cipher

📌 Internship: Prodigy InfoTech – Cyber Security

This is a simple Python program that implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm for both encryption and decryption of messages. This task is part of my internship under the Cyber Security domain.


📂 Features

- Accepts **user input** for the message and shift value
- Supports both **encryption** and **decryption**
- Preserves **uppercase**, **lowercase**, and **special characters**
- User-friendly console interface

 ⚙️ How It Works

Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

Example:  
Original: HELLO
Shift: 3
Encrypted: KHOOR
